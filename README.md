**vf solution contingent**
Design Choices
 Contingency solution for vodafone. This code consists of an http server and 
 https nodejs called cluster app.js and an invoking and speaking program called 
 caller.js, which makes the call and times the response times.
 The purpose of this code is to provide a cache for the service 
 api / service, generating an object in the file system. 
 This object of the fileSiystem, can be invoked through the service published 
 in http or https /api/servicio.cache, improving the response times of the same, 
 tuning it up to 30ms.
